# sancocss-utils
stylesheet for easier/verbose and meaning full styling for anyone does not like to create a lot of repeating a same css property and values. Pretty much inspired by Harry Roberts' : http://cssguidelin.es/ so give credits to him.

Like this? Just include this repo link in the stylesheet. And don't forget visit Harry Roberts' css guidelines websites above. Pretty much a lot of decent CSS advice.
