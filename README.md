# literallycss
stylesheet for easier/verbose and meaning full styling for anyone does not like to create a lot of repeating a same css property and values. Or you just don't want to create a lot of css rules. Just include a class name and it will implement as a css rules named. 
	
For example, you want a image full width of the container (suppose `<div>`) you can do like this
	
	`<img class="width-extend-fitcontatiner" src"..." alt="..." />`
	
Pretty much inspired by Harry Roberts' : http://cssguidelin.es/ so give credits to him. And don't forget visit Harry Roberts' css guidelines websites above. Pretty much a lot of decent CSS advice.
