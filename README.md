# literallycss
stylesheet for easier/verbose and meaning full styling for anyone does not like to create a lot of repeating a same css property and values. Or you just don't want to create a lot of css rules. Just include a class name and it will implement as a css rules named. Pretty much inspired by Harry Roberts' : http://cssguidelin.es/ so give credits to him.

And don't forget visit Harry Roberts' css guidelines websites above. Pretty much a lot of decent CSS advice.
