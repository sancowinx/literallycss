# literallycss
A collection of css helpers class for easier styling for anyone does not (or lazy enough) like to create a lot of repeating a same css property and values.  
Just include the a css helper in a class name and it will implement styling as a css rules does, literally. 
	
For example, you want a image full width of the container (suppose the `<img>` is inside the `<div>`) you can do like this
	
	`<img class="width-extend-fitcontatiner" src"..." alt="..." />`
	
Compartible with Bootstrap latest version.
	
Pretty much inspired by Harry Roberts' : http://cssguidelin.es/ so give credits to him. And don't forget visit Harry Roberts' css guidelines websites above. Pretty much a lot of decent CSS advice.
